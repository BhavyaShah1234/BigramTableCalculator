# BigramTableCalculator
This piece of code can be used for NLP exams. If the question states to create table regarding bigrams then just put in the number and/of sentences in corpus and you can get probabilities in the form of csv file. Also I have added the option to get add-one smoothing. The code creates 2 csv files(if smoothing is enabled) which contain the bigram probabiliies(with and without smoothing) in the same folder as this script. Happy copying
